# User-application

In our application we have 4 pages: Login, Registration, Profile, Dashboard. 

- Registration & Login.

Any user can register or login and validation guarantees that email will be unique. Page forms are created using - Redux-forms.

- Dashboard

On this page we can see a list of all users who will be downloaded each time we scroll down the list. I used - react-virtualized.
