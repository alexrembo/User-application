# User-application

In our application we have 4 pages: 
  Login - https://screencloud.net/v/p670v,
  Registration - https://screencloud.net/v/9Ayr2,
  Profile - https://screencloud.net/v/AvGzw,
  Dashboard - https://screencloud.net/v/1HW8l.

- Registration & Login. 

Any user can register or login and validation guarantees that email will be unique. Page forms are created using - Redux-forms.

- Dashboard

On this page we can see a list of all users who will be downloaded each time we scroll down the list. I used - react-virtualized.
